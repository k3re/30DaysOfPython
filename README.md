# 30 Days of Python 

A personal learning journey to master Python programming in 30 days, covering topics from the very basics to working with databases, APIs, and web applications.

---

## Overview
This repository contains daily Python practice exercises, mini-projects, and notes Iâ€™ve worked on as part of my **30 Days of Python** challenge.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation in Python and explore real-world applications by the end of the challenge.
